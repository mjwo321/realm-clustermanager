# realm-clustermanager

This Realm application lets you easily pause and resume MongoDB Atlas Clusters.

It works with 2 triggers

**triggerResumeAtlasClusters**

These triggers can simply be run at the specific time when the clusters should be paused and resumed.

The relevant cluster names are stored in the value **AtlasClusterNamesForPauseAndResume**
